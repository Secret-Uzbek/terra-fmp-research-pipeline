# Academic Critique and Discussion Invitation

**Repository:** Terra FMP Research Pipeline  
**Author:** Abdurashid Abdukarimov  
**Status:** Open academic discussion document

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This repository is intentionally opened for **critical academic discussion**.

The Fractal Metascience Paradigm (FMP) is presented here not as a finished theory,
but as a **working epistemic framework** that explicitly invites inspection,
challenge, and revision.

Critique is not an obstacle to this project.
It is a core operational component.

---

## 2. Who Is Invited

Participation is welcomed from:

- researchers and academics
- doctoral and postdoctoral scholars
- methodologists and theorists
- engineers and system architects
- critics skeptical of meta-frameworks
- practitioners encountering limits of existing paradigms

Formal affiliation is not required.
Argument quality is.

---

## 3. What Kind of Critique Is Especially Welcome

The following forms of critique are explicitly encouraged:

- conceptual inconsistency or ambiguity
- unclear scope or overreach
- category errors
- missing references or parallel work
- methodological weaknesses
- unclear separation of theory and implementation
- questionable assumptions
- alternative framings that invalidate parts of FMP

Disagreement is not only acceptable — it is expected.

---

## 4. What This Is Not

This repository is **not**:

- a manifesto demanding adherence
- a claim of scientific authority
- a replacement for peer-reviewed publication
- a marketing platform
- a belief system

Critical rejection is a valid outcome.

## 5. How to Participate (Practical)

Please use **GitHub Discussions** for all critique and commentary.

Suggested structure for discussion threads:

- **Title:** Clear statement of the issue or objection
- **Reference:** File, section, or concept being discussed
- **Argument:** Reasoned critique or question
- **Optional:** Counter-proposal or alternative framing

Both short and long-form contributions are welcome.

---

## 6. Author’s Commitments

The author commits to:

- reading critiques carefully
- responding where meaningful
- acknowledging valid objections
- revising or removing components when warranted
- clearly marking unresolved disagreements

No commitment is made to defend all parts of the framework.

---

## 7. Tone and Conduct

This space follows basic academic norms:

- critique ideas, not persons
- cite when possible
- separate skepticism from dismissal
- avoid rhetorical escalation

Sharp critique is welcome.
Personal attacks are not.

---

## 8. Why This Matters

Many theoretical frameworks fail not because they are wrong,
but because they are never seriously tested in open discourse.

This repository treats critique as a **structural necessity**, not a threat.

If FMP has value, it should withstand pressure.
If it does not, that should become visible.

---

## 9. Final Note

You are not expected to agree.

You are invited to think, question, and argue.

That is the only entry requirement.

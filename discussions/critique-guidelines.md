## 0. Purpose of This Document

This document defines **how critique of the Fractal Metascience Paradigm (FMP) is expected, structured, and valued**.

Critique is not treated as opposition.  
Critique is treated as a **core epistemic function** of this project.

Unstructured opinion is discouraged.  
Structured disagreement is explicitly encouraged.

## 1. What Counts as Valid Critique

A critique is considered **valid** if it satisfies at least one of the following:

### 1.1 Conceptual Critique
- Identifies internal inconsistency
- Challenges definitions or scope
- Questions necessity or novelty of claims

### 1.2 Comparative Critique
- Compares FMP claims with:
  - Kuhn
  - Lakatos
  - Feyerabend
  - Systems theory
  - Cybernetics
  - Contemporary meta-science
- Demonstrates redundancy or unacknowledged overlap

### 1.3 Formal Critique
- Challenges falsifiability
- Questions testability
- Identifies missing formalization

### 1.4 Operational Critique
- Examines the executable components
- Identifies mismatch between theory and implementation
- Points out unjustified assumptions in code or architecture

### 1.5 Ethical Critique
- Challenges the ethical layer design
- Questions explicit vs implicit ethics
- Raises risks of misuse or bias

## 2. What Does NOT Count as Critique

The following are **explicitly not considered valid critique**:

- Personal judgments about the author
- Statements of belief or disbelief without argument
- Appeals to authority without reasoning
- Vague dismissal (“this is nonsense”, “not scientific”)
- Demands for institutional validation as a prerequisite

Such inputs may be acknowledged but are not engaged epistemically.

## 3. Recommended Critique Structure

Contributors are encouraged (not required) to use the following structure:

1. **Target**
   - Which claim, file, or component is being critiqued?
2. **Position**
   - What is your main objection or alternative?
3. **Argument**
   - Logical, empirical, or comparative reasoning
4. **Implications**
   - What follows if the critique is valid?
5. **Optional Proposal**
   - Modification, removal, or alternative framing

---

## 4. Levels of Engagement

Critique can operate at different levels:

- **L0 — Surface:** terminology, clarity, presentation
- **L1 — Structural:** architecture, assumptions, boundaries
- **L2 — Meta:** epistemology, philosophy of science, ethics

All levels are acceptable.  
None are privileged a priori.

## 5. Author’s Commitments

The author commits to:

- Responding in good faith
- Distinguishing critique from hostility
- Accepting partial or full refutation
- Updating claims when justified
- Leaving rejected critiques publicly visible

No guarantee is made that all critiques will be accepted.

## 6. On Disagreement and Forking

Disagreement does not require consensus.

If a critique leads to:
- a fork,
- an alternative implementation,
- or a competing framework,

this is considered a **successful outcome**, not a failure.

## 7. Academic Use and Citation

Critiques in this repository may be cited as:
- open peer review artifacts
- pre-publication discussion
- methodological commentary

Contributors are responsible for their own claims.

## 8. Final Note

FMP is not defended by authority.

It is defended only by:
- clarity,
- openness,
- and its ability to survive critique.

If it fails — that failure is informative.

# Start Here — Discussions & Critique

Welcome.

This repository is intentionally open to **critique, questioning,
reinterpretation, and disagreement**.

Discussion is not a side feature here —
it is part of the research pipeline.

---

## 1. What This Space Is For

Use GitHub Discussions to:

- question assumptions
- challenge concepts
- propose alternative framings
- identify weaknesses
- suggest extensions
- test interpretations

Critical engagement is not only allowed — it is expected.

---

## 2. What This Space Is NOT For

Please do **not** use discussions for:

- feature requests
- product expectations
- ML performance debates
- commercialization proposals
- political or ideological arguments
- personal attacks

This is a **research dialogue space**, not a support forum.

---

## 3. Recommended Discussion Types

When opening a discussion, consider one of the following framings:

### A. Conceptual Critique
- Is the framing coherent?
- Are assumptions justified?
- Are concepts overloaded or vague?

### B. Methodological Questions
- Why this structure?
- Why no learning?
- Why executable theory?

### C. Comparative Analysis
- Comparison with ML systems
- Comparison with symbolic AI
- Relation to existing philosophical frameworks

### D. Interpretative Readings
- Your understanding of FMP
- Alternative philosophical lenses
- Critical reinterpretations

### E. Ethical Analysis
- Limits of explicit ethics
- Failure modes
- Responsibility boundaries

## 4. How to Be Most Helpful

Strong contributions usually include:

- clear claims
- explicit reasoning
- references (when relevant)
- concrete examples
- willingness to revise positions

You do **not** need to agree with the author.
Disagreement is valuable.

---

## 5. Author’s Position

The author does not claim:

- finality
- correctness
- completeness
- authority

The author *does* claim responsibility
for the structure presented here.

---

## 6. Minimal Discussion Template (Optional)

You may structure your post as:

Claim:
Reasoning:
Implications:
Questions:


This is optional, not mandatory.

---

## 7. Meta-Rule

If a discussion reveals a structural issue,
it may result in:

- changes to theory
- changes to code
- changes to documentation
- explicit recorded disagreement

All outcomes are valid.

## 8. Closing Statement

> This repository treats critique
> not as a threat,
> but as a **necessary operational component**
> of thinking systems.

Thank you for participating.

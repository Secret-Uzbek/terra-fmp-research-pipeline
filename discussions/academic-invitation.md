# Invitation to Academic Discussion and Critique

**Repository:** Terra FMP Research Pipeline  
**Author:** Abdurashid Abdukarimov  
**Status:** Open for discussion

---

## 1. Purpose of This Space

This repository is not presented as a finished theory or a validated system.

It is presented as a **research pipeline** —  
a structured environment where theory, executable artifacts, and critique can coexist.

This document formally invites:
- academic discussion,
- methodological critique,
- conceptual challenges,
- and collaborative refinement.

---

## 2. What Is Open for Discussion

Contributors are explicitly invited to engage with:

### 2.1 Conceptual Foundations
- Fractal Metascience Paradigm (FMP)
- meta-methodological positioning
- relation to systems theory, complexity science, and philosophy of science

### 2.2 Operational Artifacts
- Terra Semantic System (L0–L1)
- ethical constraints as explicit layers
- executable HTML prototypes as epistemic demonstrations

### 2.3 Methodological Assumptions
- recursion as a research strategy
- self-similarity across knowledge scales
- integration without reduction

## 3. What This Repository Is NOT Asking For

This is **not** a request for:
- endorsement
- belief
- agreement

Critical disagreement is not only allowed — it is expected.

---

## 4. How to Participate

Please use **GitHub Discussions** for structured engagement.

Suggested discussion categories:
- Conceptual critique
- Methodological objections
- Comparison with existing frameworks
- Suggestions for empirical grounding
- Failure modes and limitations

When possible, please:
- reference specific files or sections
- distinguish critique of claims from critique of presentation
- avoid ad hominem arguments

---

## 5. Academic Positioning

FMP does not claim disciplinary authority.

It positions itself as:
- a coordination framework
- a methodological experiment
- an epistemic infrastructure

Any future validation must occur through:
- independent research
- domain-specific studies
- peer-reviewed processes

---

## 6. Attribution and Use

All materials are shared for:
- examination
- critique
- reuse with attribution

Licensing details are provided in the repository root.

---

## 7. Closing Statement

This repository exists to be *tested*, not defended.

If the framework fails under scrutiny, that failure is itself a valid research outcome.

Discussion is the mechanism by which this system either evolves — or dissolves.

# Terra FMP Research Pipeline

This repository is a **research pipeline** for the Fractal Metascience Paradigm (FMP).

It integrates:
- theoretical foundations,
- executable semantic systems,
- ethical constraints,
- and academic discussion pathways

into a single reproducible structure.

This is **not** a software product and **not** a finished theory.
It is an **epistemic infrastructure**.

---

## What this repository is

- A coordination layer between theory, code, and critique
- A reproducible research environment
- A “living system” rather than a static publication

---

## Core components

- **FMP (Fractal Metascience Paradigm)** — meta-scientific framework
- **Terra Semantic System (L0–L1)** — executable semantic kernel
- **Ethical Layer** — local, explicit content constraints
- **Live HTML Prototype** — proof of operationality
- **Discussion Pipeline** — structured academic critique

---

## Repository structure (overview)

theory/ — conceptual foundations
systems/ — semantic and ethical architecture
implementations/ — live systems and demos
pipelines/ — academic & technical workflows
discussions/ — critique and collaboration entry points


---

## Status

This repository represents a **24-hour integration snapshot**.

Nothing here claims finality.
Everything here is open to:
- inspection
- critique
- mutation

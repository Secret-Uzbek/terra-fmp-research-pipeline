# Fractal Metascience Paradigm (FMP) — Overview

The Fractal Metascience Paradigm proposes that
scientific knowledge evolves **fractally**, not linearly.

---

## Core assumption

Knowledge does not:
- accumulate strictly
- replace itself in revolutions
- converge to a final form

Instead, it:
- expands recursively
- preserves prior structures
- reinterprets itself across scales

---

## Epistemic triad

Every act of knowledge involves:

1. Observer
2. System
3. Interface

None of these can be reduced to the others.

---

## Fractality

At every scale:
- concepts resemble larger structures
- methods reflect meta-methods
- critique mirrors construction

---

## Role of computation

Computation is not an oracle.

It is:
- an interface
- a simulator
- a constraint-enforcing medium

---

## Status

FMP is not complete.

It is:
- open
- falsifiable through practice
- embodied partially in Terra systems

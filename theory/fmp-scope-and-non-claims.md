# Fractal Metascience Paradigm — Scope and Non-Claims

**Author:** Abdurashid Abdukarimov  
**Context:** Terra FMP Research Pipeline  
**Status:** Conceptual clarification document

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document explicitly defines:

- what the Fractal Metascience Paradigm (FMP) **addresses**
- what it **does not attempt to do**
- which interpretations are **out of scope**

Its purpose is not defensive rhetoric, but epistemic hygiene.

---

## 2. Scope of the Fractal Metascience Paradigm

FMP operates at the level of **meta-scientific organization**, not domain science.

### FMP concerns:

- how knowledge systems are structured across scales
- how theoretical, operational, and ethical layers interact
- how recursion and self-similarity appear in epistemic processes
- how executable artifacts can coexist with conceptual reasoning
- how limits, constraints, and uncertainty are made explicit

FMP is a **framework for thinking about systems of knowledge**, not a theory of nature itself.

---

## 3. What FMP Explicitly Claims

FMP claims only the following:

1. Complex knowledge systems exhibit **scale-dependent structural similarity**
2. Scientific reasoning benefits from **explicit separation of layers**:
   - conceptual
   - operational
   - ethical
3. Executable artifacts can serve as **epistemic illustrations**, not proofs
4. Ethical constraints are not external add-ons but **first-class structural elements**
5. No single representation exhausts a system’s meaning

These are methodological and epistemological claims, not empirical laws.

---

## 4. Non-Claims (Explicit)

FMP **does not claim**:

- to be a unified theory of science
- to replace existing scientific disciplines
- to provide predictive power by itself
- to guarantee correctness, truth, or optimality
- to be complete, final, or universal
- to supersede peer review or empirical validation
- to solve intelligence, consciousness, or ethics
- to offer metaphysical or theological authority

Any such interpretation is a misreading.

---

## 5. Relation to Mathematics and Formal Proof

FMP is **not a formal axiomatic system**.

- It does not present theorems with proofs
- It does not define a closed formal language
- It does not claim mathematical completeness or consistency

Mathematical structures may be referenced illustratively, not foundationally.

---

## 6. Relation to Empirical Science

FMP does not generate empirical hypotheses by itself.

Instead, it:

- provides a way to **organize hypotheses**
- clarifies where empirical validation is required
- separates observational claims from structural assumptions

Empirical adequacy must be established independently.

---

## 7. Relation to Artificial Intelligence

FMP does not claim:

- to define intelligence
- to produce general AI
- to outperform existing AI systems

Executable AI-related components in this repository are **demonstrative**, not competitive benchmarks.

---

## 8. Temporal and Contextual Limits

All artifacts in this repository represent:

- a **time-bound snapshot**
- a specific authorial perspective
- a limited experimental integration

Future revisions may invalidate parts of the current framing.

This is expected, not a failure.

---

## 9. Responsibility of the Reader

Readers are invited to:

- critique assumptions
- test interpretations
- reject components that do not convince

No part of FMP requires belief.
Only examination.

---

## 10. Final Clarification

Fractal Metascience Paradigm is an **opening framework**, not a closing theory.

Its success is measured not by acceptance,
but by the quality of discussion it enables.

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines **what the Fractal Metascience Paradigm (FMP) explicitly claims**  
and, equally important, **what it explicitly does not claim**.

Its purpose is to prevent:
- category errors,
- overextension,
- and misinterpretation in academic discourse.

---

## 2. What FMP Claims

FMP asserts the following:

### 2.1 Meta-Methodological Claim
FMP is a **meta-scientific framework** for organizing, relating, and iterating across
multiple knowledge domains using fractal principles.

It operates *above* specific sciences, not instead of them.

---

### 2.2 Structural Claim
Knowledge systems across scales (cognitive, social, technical) exhibit:

- recursive structure
- self-similarity of reasoning patterns
- scale-invariant coordination problems

FMP provides a language and methodology to **work with these structures explicitly**.

---

### 2.3 Operational Claim
FMP is **operationalizable**, meaning:

- parts of the framework can be instantiated as executable systems
- semantic kernels and ethical layers can be implemented
- reasoning processes can be partially formalized

This repository demonstrates *prototypes*, not final systems.

---

### 2.4 Epistemic Claim
FMP supports **plural epistemologies** and does not privilege a single
cultural, disciplinary, or methodological perspective.

Integration is achieved through coordination, not reduction.

---

## 3. What FMP Does NOT Claim

FMP explicitly does **not** claim:

### 3.1 No New Physical Laws
FMP does not propose new laws of physics, biology, or cosmology.

It does not compete with empirical sciences at the level of data or experiments.

---

### 3.2 No Universal Theory
FMP is **not** a Theory of Everything.

It does not aim to subsume all disciplines into a single explanatory system.

---

### 3.3 No Replacement of Existing Methods
FMP does not replace:

- scientific method
- peer review
- statistical validation
- domain-specific expertise

It is complementary, not substitutive.

---

### 3.4 No Claims of Empirical Proof
Current implementations demonstrate **feasibility**, not empirical validation.

Any future empirical claims require independent, domain-specific studies.

---

## 4. Relation to Philosophy and Science

FMP is positioned:

- closer to methodology than ontology
- closer to systems theory than metaphysics
- closer to research infrastructure than doctrine

It may intersect with philosophy of science, but it does not assert philosophical authority.

---

## 5. Use in Publications

This document SHOULD be referenced or summarized in:

- arXiv preprints
- journal submissions
- grant proposals
- public explanations

It SHOULD NOT be treated as a defensive disclaimer,
but as a clarification of scientific intent.

---

## 6. Evolution of Claims

Claims defined here are:

- versioned
- open to revision
- subject to critique

Changes to this document require:
- explicit rationale
- traceable version history

---

## 7. Final Boundary Statement

FMP is a **framework for thinking about how knowledge systems relate and evolve**.

It does not claim truth —  
it claims *structure, process, and coordination*.

# Fractal Metascience Paradigm (FMP)
## Formal Claims and Testable Positions

**Author:** Abdurashid Abdukarimov  
**Ecosystem:** AIUZ Terra  
**Status:** Open for critique, replication, falsification

## 0. Scope and Intent

This document enumerates the **formal claims** of the Fractal Metascience Paradigm (FMP).

These claims are intentionally:
- explicit,
- bounded,
- open to criticism,
- independent of belief or authority.

FMP does **not** claim to replace existing sciences.  
It claims to provide a **meta-scientific coordination layer** across them.

## 1. Core Claim (C1): Fractal Knowledge Growth

**Claim C1**

> Scientific knowledge does not evolve strictly linearly or exclusively through paradigm shifts, but through **fractal expansion**, where new structures recursively reproduce and refine earlier epistemic patterns across scales.

**Implications**
- Knowledge growth is neither purely cumulative nor purely revolutionary.
- Self-similarity exists between micro (methods), meso (disciplines), and macro (paradigms) levels.

**Testability**
- Structural similarity analysis of scientific methods across disciplines
- Network topology comparison of citation graphs over time

## 2. Claim C2: Observer–System–Interface Triad

**Claim C2**

> Any scientific act necessarily involves a triadic structure:  
> **Observer – System – Interface**, where the interface actively shapes what can be observed, modeled, and validated.

**Clarification**
- The interface includes instruments, models, languages, AI systems, and formal frameworks.
- The observer is never epistemically external.

**Relation to prior work**
- Extends Kuhn’s paradigm dependence
- Formalizes the role of computational and semantic interfaces

**Falsifiability**
- Demonstrate a scientific observation independent of interface mediation

## 3. Claim C3: Explicit Ethics as Structural Requirement

**Claim C3**

> Ethical constraints in scientific systems must be **explicitly encoded and inspectable**, rather than implicit, post-hoc, or delegated to institutional norms.

**Position**
- Ethics is a structural layer, not a policy afterthought.
- “Neutral tools” are a myth in complex socio-technical systems.

**Operational Evidence**
- Terra FMP Live prototype includes an explicit ethical validation layer.
- Constraints are local, readable, and modifiable.

## 4. Claim C4: Executability as Epistemic Criterion

**Claim C4**

> A scientific framework gains epistemic strength when its core assumptions can be made **executable**, even in minimal, non-ML, non-statistical form.

**Explanation**
- Executability ≠ correctness
- Executability = inspectability + reproducibility

**Consequence**
- Purely verbal meta-theories are epistemically weak.
- Even minimal executable kernels improve falsifiability.

## 5. Claim C5: Meta-Science Requires Infrastructure, Not Just Theory

**Claim C5**

> Meta-science cannot remain a purely philosophical activity; it requires **operational infrastructures** that coordinate theory, implementation, critique, and revision.

**Evidence**
- Fragmentation between theory papers, code, and ethical review
- Lack of reproducible meta-scientific environments

**FMP Position**
- A repository can be a scientific instrument.
- Pipelines are epistemic objects.

---

## 6. Claim C6: Zero-Budget Viability

**Claim C6**

> Meaningful scientific and meta-scientific work can be produced under **zero or near-zero infrastructure conditions**, provided architectural clarity and openness.

**Context**
- Challenges the funding-dependence assumption in modern science.
- Relevant for constrained environments and global equity.

---

## 7. Non-Claims (Explicit Limits)

FMP does **not** claim:
- to be a unified theory of everything
- to invalidate existing scientific methods
- to provide predictive superiority by default
- to replace peer review

FMP explicitly invites:
- rejection,
- modification,
- partial adoption.

---

## 8. Open Problems

- Quantitative metrics for fractal epistemic similarity
- Formal logic of multi-scale validation
- Institutional resistance to explicit ethics layers
- Risk of over-generalization

These problems are considered **constitutive**, not flaws.

## 9. Citation Note

This document is intended to be cited as a **position and claims paper**, not as an empirical study.

Suggested citation (draft):

## 10. Invitation to Critique

Critique is not a threat to FMP.

Critique **is the validation mechanism**.

Discussions, counterexamples, and formal objections are explicitly encouraged via:
- GitHub Discussions
- academic correspondence
- comparative studies

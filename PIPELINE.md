# PIPELINE — How Terra FMP Works

This file describes the **operational logic** of the Terra FMP Research Pipeline.

It should be read as a **research process**, not a software pipeline.

---

## Inputs

- Conceptual framework (FMP)
- Natural language input (user / researcher)
- Local files and documents
- Ethical constraints

---

## Core process

### 1. Semantic intake
- Text enters the system
- Intent and keywords are extracted (L0)
- Content is checked against ethical filters

### 2. Semantic enrichment
- Offline semantic analysis (L1)
- Keyword frequency
- Concept detection
- Domain hints

### 3. Archival fixation
- Input + analysis become an archive object
- Archives are immutable once created
- Archives are searchable semantically

### 4. FMP Reasoning
The same query is interpreted through three roles:

- Internal Analyst
- External Observer
- Meta-Archivist

No single role is authoritative.

---

## Outputs

- Archived semantic objects
- Traceable reasoning artifacts
- Human-readable explanations
- Discussion-ready material

---

## Feedback loop

- Human critique
- Manual modification
- Forking and mutation
- Re-ingestion into the pipeline

This loop is **intentional** and **necessary**.

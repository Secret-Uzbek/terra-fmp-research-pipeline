# Citation and Academic Mapping Pipeline  
## Positioning the Fractal Metascience Paradigm (FMP) in Existing Scholarly Systems

**Repository:** Terra FMP Research Pipeline  
**Status:** Active  
**Author:** Abdurashid Abdukarimov

---

## 0. Scope and Intent

This document defines how materials in this repository may be:
- cited,
- referenced,
- positioned,
within existing academic infrastructures.

FMP is not presented as a replacement for established disciplines,  
but as a **meta-framework spanning multiple domains**.

---

## 1. Citation Identity

Until journal publication, the canonical citation unit is:

> Abdukarimov, A. (Year). *Fractal Metascience Paradigm (FMP): Research Pipeline and Executable Prototypes*. GitHub repository.

DOI assignment (e.g. via Zenodo) is recommended but not required at this stage.

---

## 2. Recommended Citation Granularity

Different artifacts should be cited differently:

| Artifact Type | Citation Level |
|--------------|----------------|
| Conceptual framework | Whole repository |
| Specific model | Individual markdown file |
| Executable prototype | HTML / code artifact |
| Ethical logic | Ethical layer documentation |
| Pipeline logic | Specific pipeline document |

Avoid citing “everything at once” unless contextually necessary.

---

## 3. Disciplinary Mapping (Non-Exclusive)

FMP intersects with the following indexed domains:

- Complexity Science
- Systems Theory
- Philosophy of Science
- Artificial Intelligence (AI ethics, semantic systems)
- Science, Technology & Society (STS)
- Computational Social Science

It should be mapped as **transdisciplinary**, not standalone.

---

## 4. Indexing Compatibility

### 4.1 arXiv
Recommended categories:
- cs.AI
- cs.CY
- physics.soc-ph
- q-bio.OT (context-dependent)

Role: preprint dissemination and timestamping.

---

### 4.2 Scopus / Web of Science
Target journal profiles:
- complexity / systems journals
- futures studies
- interdisciplinary methodology journals

The repository functions as:
- supplementary material
- methodological appendix
- executable artifact reference

---

### 4.3 National Indexes (e.g. RINC, VAK)
Recommended approach:
- publish focused fragments
- reference the repository as infrastructure
- avoid claiming “new science” status explicitly

---

## 5. Relation to Prior Work

FMP should be positioned as:

- synthesizing existing theories
- operationalizing abstract principles
- providing executable epistemology

Avoid claims of:
- paradigm replacement
- universal unification
- final theory status

---

## 6. Author Positioning

The author is positioned as:

- framework proposer
- system integrator
- methodological experimenter

Not as:
- sole authority
- final arbiter
- disciplinary gatekeeper

---

## 7. Self-Citation Policy

Self-citation is acceptable when:
- explicitly declared
- contextually justified
- proportionate

Excessive recursive citation is discouraged.

---

## 8. External Citation Invitations

Researchers are explicitly invited to:
- critique specific claims
- test components independently
- fork and reinterpret the framework

Citation does not imply endorsement.

---

## 9. Living Citation Model

This repository uses a **living citation model**:
- citations evolve as the system evolves
- versions matter
- timestamps matter

Static snapshots are acceptable but incomplete.

---

## 10. Final Note

Academic legitimacy is not claimed.  
It is **earned through traceable reasoning and open exposure**.

This pipeline exists to make that process possible.

# arXiv Preprint Mapping

**Repository:** Terra FMP Research Pipeline  
**Author:** Abdurashid Abdukarimov  
**Purpose:** Mapping repository artifacts to an arXiv preprint

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This file defines how (and how not) this repository maps to an arXiv preprint.

Key principle:

> **The arXiv preprint is a narrative exposition.  
> The repository is an epistemic infrastructure.**

They are related, but not equivalent.

---

## 2. What the arXiv Preprint IS

The arXiv submission should be:

- a **conceptual paper**
- focused on **Fractal Metascience Paradigm (FMP)**
- describing:
  - motivation
  - scope
  - epistemic positioning
  - illustrative operational examples

The preprint is:
- linear
- finite
- readable as a standalone text

---

## 3. What the arXiv Preprint IS NOT

The arXiv paper is **not**:

- a full dump of this repository
- a software documentation
- a proof of correctness
- a claim of empirical validation
- a specification of a production system

No claim in the preprint depends on executing the code.

---

## 4. Recommended arXiv Categories

Primary (choose one):

- `cs.AI` — Artificial Intelligence (conceptual systems)
- `cs.CY` — Computers and Society (ethics & epistemology)
- `cs.LO` — Logic in Computer Science (meta-frameworks)

Optional secondary:

- `nlin.AO` — Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems
- `phil-sci` — Philosophy of Science (if appropriate)

---

## 5. Suggested Preprint Structure

Recommended section mapping:

### Abstract
High-level framing of FMP as a meta-scientific paradigm.

### 1. Introduction
Motivation: limits of linear epistemologies in complex systems.

### 2. Fractal Metascience Paradigm
Core concepts:
- self-similarity
- recursion
- scale-invariant reasoning

### 3. Epistemic Architecture
How theory, code, and ethics coexist without collapsing into one domain.

### 4. Operational Illustration
Reference (not reproduce) the Terra Semantic System as an example.

### 5. Ethical Constraints
Explain explicit ethical layers as first-class epistemic objects.

### 6. Limitations and Non-Claims
What this work explicitly does *not* claim.

### 7. Relation to the Repository
Explain that:
- the repository contains executable and structural artifacts
- the preprint explains the conceptual logic
- neither subsumes the other

### 8. Conclusion
Position the work as an opening, not a closure.

## 6. How to Reference the Repository

In the arXiv paper:

- cite the Zenodo DOI (once minted)
- optionally include GitHub link as supplementary material
- avoid phrases like “the system proves”
- prefer “the repository demonstrates a possible instantiation”

Example wording:

> An accompanying open repository (DOI: xxx) contains executable artifacts
> illustrating selected components of the framework, without constituting
> empirical validation.

---

## 7. Versioning Discipline

Rules:

- arXiv v1 corresponds to Zenodo snapshot v0.1.0
- major conceptual changes → new arXiv version
- minor clarifications → repository commits only

The arXiv paper should **lag**, not chase, repository changes.

---

## 8. Reviewer-Resistant Framing

Recommended defensive language:

- “illustrative”
- “conceptual”
- “epistemic”
- “non-exhaustive”
- “time-bound snapshot”

Avoid:

- “optimal”
- “universal”
- “complete”
- “solves”
- “guarantees”

---

## 9. Epistemic Statement

The arXiv preprint exists to make the framework *discussable*.

The repository exists to make the framework *inspectable*.

Neither replaces peer review.
Neither claims authority.
Both invite critique.

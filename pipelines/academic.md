# Academic Pipeline — Terra / FMP

This document defines how the Terra FMP repository
can be used, cited, extended, and defended
within academic and research-oriented contexts.

---

## 1. Positioning

This repository is positioned as:

- A **conceptual–technical research artifact**
- An **executable epistemic prototype**
- A bridge between:
  - philosophy of science
  - computational semantics
  - systems thinking
  - ethical AI research

It is **not** positioned as:
- a commercial product
- an ML benchmark
- a production-ready system

---

## 2. Research Identity

Recommended descriptors:

- "Executable epistemology"
- "Fractal metascientific system"
- "Local semantic architecture"
- "Non-statistical AI prototype"
- "Ethically explicit reasoning system"

Core framing:
> *The system is the argument.*

---

## 3. Suitable Academic Domains

This work may be situated in:

- Philosophy of Science
- Science and Technology Studies (STS)
- Digital Humanities
- Computational Linguistics (theoretical)
- AI Ethics and Governance
- Systems Theory
- Meta-science

## 4. Citation Model

### Recommended citation format

Abdukarimov, A. (2025).
Terra FMP: An executable prototype for fractal metascience.
GitHub repository. https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO


Optionally add:
- commit hash
- tagged release
- Zenodo DOI (recommended later)

---

## 5. How to Present the Work

### In papers / talks

Emphasize:
- Transparency over performance
- Inspectability over accuracy
- Structure over prediction
- Explicit limitations

Avoid claims about:
- intelligence
- cognition
- human equivalence
- learning capability

---

## 6. Review Strategy

Anticipate reviewer questions:

**Q: Where is the learning?**  
A: Learning is intentionally excluded to isolate structure.

**Q: Where is evaluation?**  
A: This is a *constructive epistemic artifact*, not a benchmark.

**Q: Why not ML?**  
A: To demonstrate what exists *before* statistics.

**Q: Is this AI?**  
A: It depends on the definition; the system makes this question explicit.

---

## 7. Reproducibility

Reproducibility is guaranteed by:

- Zero external dependencies
- Deterministic logic
- Browser-executable artifact
- Full source transparency

Any researcher can reproduce the system
by cloning the repository and opening the HTML file.

---

## 8. Ethical Position

Ethics are:

- Explicit
- Local
- Pattern-based
- Inspectable
- Non-adaptive

This avoids:
- opaque moderation
- post-hoc rationalization
- hidden policy layers

---

## 9. Recommended Academic Outputs

This repository may support:

- Conceptual papers
- Position papers
- Workshop demos
- Doctoral methodology chapters
- Critical responses
- Teaching materials

---

## 10. Future Academic Extensions (Optional)

- Formal logic mapping of FMP layers
- Comparative study vs ML systems
- Empirical user studies (UI/UX)
- Philosophical critique of executable theory
- Integration with open science infrastructure

---

## 11. Canonical Statement

> Terra FMP is not a claim about intelligence.
> It is a claim about **structure, responsibility,
> and the possibility of thinking differently
> about thinking systems**.

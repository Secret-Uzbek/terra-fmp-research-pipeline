# Review-to-Revision Flow  
## From Critique to Change in the Fractal Metascience Paradigm (FMP)

## 0. Purpose

This document defines how **external critique is transformed into internal revision** within the FMP research pipeline.

The goal is to make epistemic change:
- explicit,
- traceable,
- and reproducible.

Critique is not an endpoint.  
Critique is an **input signal**.

---

## 1. Entry Points for Critique

Critique may enter the system via:

- GitHub Discussions
- Issues (if applicable)
- Fork-based counter-implementations
- External references explicitly linked back

Each critique must reference at least one:
- claim,
- file,
- component,
- or architectural decision.

---

## 2. Initial Classification Phase

Upon reception, critique is classified into one or more categories:

| Category | Description |
|--------|------------|
| Conceptual | Definitions, scope, framing |
| Formal | Logic, falsifiability, rigor |
| Operational | Code, architecture, execution |
| Ethical | Constraints, risks, assumptions |
| Meta | Epistemology, philosophy of science |

This classification is descriptive, not evaluative.

---

## 3. Evaluation Modes

Each critique is evaluated under one of the following modes:

### 3.1 Accepted
- Critique identifies a valid flaw or improvement
- Revision is required

### 3.2 Partially Accepted
- Core concern is valid
- Proposed solution is modified

### 3.3 Rejected
- Argument insufficient or misapplied
- Rejection must be reasoned and documented

### 3.4 Deferred
- Critique acknowledged
- Revision postponed due to scope or dependency

All modes remain publicly visible.

---

## 4. Revision Actions

Accepted or partially accepted critiques may trigger:

- Textual revision (theory/)
- Architectural change (systems/)
- Code modification (implementations/)
- Pipeline adjustment (pipelines/)
- Ethical constraint update

Each revision must reference:
- the originating critique,
- the decision mode,
- and the rationale.

---

## 5. Traceability Rules

Every revision must be traceable via at least one of:

- Commit message reference
- Inline comment or annotation
- Version note (e.g. v1.1-detox, v2.0-codex)

Silent changes are discouraged.

---

## 6. Versioning Logic

Revisions are grouped into versions according to impact:

| Impact Level | Version Type |
|-------------|-------------|
| Minor clarification | Patch |
| Structural change | Minor |
| Paradigm-level change | Major |

Versioning is semantic but not rigidly standardized.

---

## 7. Negative Results and Non-Revision

If critique does **not** lead to revision:

- The critique remains visible
- The rationale for non-revision is documented
- No attempt is made to suppress dissent

Failure to revise is considered a **data point**, not a weakness.

---

## 8. Forks as Parallel Experiments

Forks are treated as:

- alternative hypotheses
- parallel implementations
- competing interpretations

No attempt is made to “merge everything back”.

Divergence is acceptable.

---

## 9. Alignment with Academic Review

This pipeline is designed to be:

- compatible with open peer review
- adaptable to journal submission cycles
- usable as a methodological appendix

It does not replace journals.  
It exposes the process journals usually hide.

---

## 10. Final Statement

The credibility of FMP does not depend on agreement.

It depends on whether:
- critique can enter,
- reasoning is visible,
- and change is accountable.

This document defines that contract.

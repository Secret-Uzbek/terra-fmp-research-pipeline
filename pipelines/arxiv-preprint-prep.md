# arXiv Preprint Preparation Pipeline  
## Safe and Minimal Entry of FMP into Preprint Infrastructure

**Repository:** Terra FMP Research Pipeline  
**Status:** Recommended  
**Author:** Abdurashid Abdukarimov

---

## 0. Purpose

This document defines a **low-risk, editor-compatible strategy** for submitting
materials derived from this repository to arXiv.

The goal is **timestamped academic exposure**, not immediate validation.

---

## 1. What the arXiv Preprint IS

The arXiv submission SHOULD be:

- a focused conceptual paper
- a methodological note
- or an executable-system description

It SHOULD NOT be:
- a repository dump
- a manifesto
- a claim of paradigm replacement

---

## 2. Recommended Preprint Types (Choose One)

### Option A — Conceptual Core
Title example:
> *Fractal Metascience Paradigm (FMP): A Meta-Methodological Framework*

Contents:
- problem statement
- positioning relative to systems theory / complexity
- conceptual schema
- limits and scope

No code required.

---

### Option B — Executable Semantics
Title example:
> *Executable Semantic Kernels for Meta-Scientific Reasoning: A Prototype Study*

Contents:
- semantic kernel description (L0–L1)
- ethical constraints
- architecture overview
- reference to live HTML prototype (GitHub)

This option is often **better received**.

---

### Option C — Methodological Infrastructure
Title example:
> *From Theory to Execution: A Reproducible Research Pipeline for Meta-Scientific Systems*

Contents:
- research pipeline logic
- repository-as-method
- discussion mechanisms
- reproducibility focus

Safest option for first submission.

---

## 3. Explicit Non-Claims (Highly Recommended Section)

Include a section titled:

> **What This Paper Does Not Claim**

Explicitly state:
- no new physical laws
- no universal theory
- no replacement of existing disciplines
- no empirical validation beyond prototypes

This dramatically lowers rejection probability.

---

## 4. arXiv Categories (Choose Conservatively)

Primary:
- cs.AI
- cs.CY

Secondary (optional):
- physics.soc-ph
- cs.SE

Avoid:
- “General Physics”
- overly philosophical-only categories

---

## 5. Relation to Repository

Include a short section:

> **Supplementary Material**

State clearly:
- the GitHub repository is supporting infrastructure
- it contains executable artifacts and discussion pipelines
- the paper stands independently

Never require the repository to understand the paper.

---

## 6. Style Constraints

arXiv-friendly writing means:

- neutral academic tone
- restrained vocabulary
- explicit definitions
- no rhetorical escalation
- no grand conclusions

Think:
> “method note”, not “revolution”.

---

## 7. Versioning Strategy

Recommended:
- v1: conceptual clarity
- v2: respond to feedback
- v3+: link to peer-reviewed submissions

arXiv allows iteration. Use it.

---

## 8. Expected Outcomes

Correct expectations:
- visibility
- timestamp
- informal feedback
- citation anchor

Incorrect expectations:
- endorsement
- validation
- authority

---

## 9. Failure Modes to Avoid

Do NOT:
- submit multiple unrelated ideas
- reference unpublished personal theories excessively
- invent new terminology without anchors
- frame criticism as misunderstanding

---

## 10. Final Note

arXiv is a **doorway, not a podium**.

This pipeline exists to help you enter without being pushed back out.
